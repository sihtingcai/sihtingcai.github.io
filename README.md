# Sih-Ting Cai, PhD
Short bio: 
Sih-Ting Cai is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University Bloomington. She holds a PhD from the University of Pittsburgh and an MPA from New York University.
Cai’s research lies at the intersection of health economics and health policy, focusing on the private provision of public services and the long-term sustainability of the U.S. healthcare system. She studies how market structure, insurance design, and public programs shape access to care, healthcare spending, and health outcomes, particularly for high-cost, high-need populations.
Much of her work centers on the dialysis sector, where she has examined facility acquisitions, the expansion of Medicare Advantage to individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and Medicaid’s role in pre-ESRD nephrology care. Building on this foundation, she is extending her research toward broader questions in Medicare Advantage, including market dynamics and policy implications for access and equity.
More recently, Cai has extended her research to pharmaceutical innovation, examining how coverage policy and market incentives influence the adoption and spending of GLP-1 therapies for diabetes and obesity, with broader implications for drug pricing and healthcare costs. Her research has been published in leading journals, including the Journal of Health Economics, JAMA Network Open, and the Journal of General Internal Medicine, and presented at major health economics and policy conferences.
